    "Arduino is an umbrella for a set of open hardware embedded devices extensively used in the maker community. If you are unfamiliar with them but are interested in Internet Of Things (IOT) it may be worthwhile to watch a YouTube video or two, read the Wikipedia article and so forth. To cut to the chase I provide some summary bullets from the perspective of 'how do I get stuff to work?'\n",

    "* The most commonly used Arduino form factor is the Arduino Uno. This device runs about $15 and it includes some nicely arranged headers that facilitate _rapid prototyping_. Headers are just rows of pin receptacles: Little wires jump from the header to an adjacent breadboard or device and the project is off and running. The most important point is that the Arduino stack makes it fairly easy to connect to devices both with physical wires and with code.\n",
