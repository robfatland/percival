    "This two-day Lightweight Data Systems (LWDS) workshop is a collective thought process effort – \n",
    "responding to a common impulse in [earth system] science: \n",
    "“I’d like to build a small data management system; so how should I proceed?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing from our collective domain interests we are exploring \n",
    "“What are the considerations we can share in response?” \n",
    "towards data management that does more than merely check the DMP box in an NSF proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain research is complex and detailed; so with this topic. \n",
    "We will consider a number of leading questions; including \n",
    "‘How far down the complexity rabbit hole can such a system go?’ \n",
    "i.e. if research divides roughly into perfunctory and exploratory phases: \n",
    "When why and how can perfunctory analysis be formalized as a service \n",
    "that everyone can use? \n",
    "And is there a commensurate Triumph of the Commons where this community benefits from sharing data?"

    "\n",
    "Written with the \"modest research team\" as the target audience. Not necessarily but quite possibly in a scientific domain.\n",
