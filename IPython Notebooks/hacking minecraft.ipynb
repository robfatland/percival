    "This notebook does not do anything interesting. Do you want to know why? Because the Python code here is designed to talk to a Minecraft server. In other words: There are some other steps you must take before this code works. \n",
    "\n",
    "But I bet you are wondering what this code does. So I'll tell you. You know how if you go into a factory there are big machines that can make stuff everywhere? This code is that: A factory. If you go into a Minecraft world and run some of these machines they will build things near you. \n",

    "They can build enormous hollow spheres. \n",

    "They can build triangular plates.\n",

    "They can build pathways in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can build enormous castles in the sky that leak water and lava in fountains to the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be modified to do just about anything you can imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this code you would need to consult with the club advisors. They will be able to give you a sense of what it would take to make all of this happen; and they can also provide a demonstration.\n",
