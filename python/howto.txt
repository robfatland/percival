When you have a prompt in Linux it means you can type a command. Your prompt tends to look like this: 

pi@raspberrypi ~ $

Here you can find out what is in this directory using 'ls':

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ ls

... and so on. Here are the basic commands: 

Make a directory: mkdir <dir>
Delete a directory: rmdir <dir>

Delete a file: rm <file>

Where am I?: pwd

Go down a level: cd <dir>
Go up a level: cd ..

What is here?: ls
What is in directory <dir>?: ls <dir>

What is in this file?: more <file>
    I want to see the next line of 'more': <Enter> key
    I want to see the next page of 'more': <spacebar> key
    I want to stop seeing 'more': <q> key

## Using the vi text editor
##
####################


From the command line, to edit the file 'boom.py': vi boom.py


There are three different editing modes: 

<esc> mode lets me move around and manipulate the text in a meta-way
	x deletes a character
	dd deletes a line
	dw deletes a word

	yyp grabs the current line and copies it below

	ZZ saves the file and exits vi

<insert> mode lets me type in new text
	i is insert before cursor
	a is append after cursor
	o is open a new blankline below
	O is open a new blankline above

<command> mode lets me issue commands down at the bottom
