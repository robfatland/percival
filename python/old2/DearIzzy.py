print """Hello my sweet darling Izzaboom
I love you so very much and I completely
understand how you and Claire were having
loads of fun together and didn't want to
stop. You mentioned that you were focused
on how you were feeling at the time and
that got in the way of you thinking about
how you might be making me feel. What is 
cool is how quickly you understood the situation
from both of our points of view. That is
empathy. :-)
Wow I just heard a very loud crash of thunder!
I love you! Thank you for the python letter!
<3<3<3
